    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken (cut into pieces)</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Cumin powder</li>
        <li>Coriander powder</li>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Basmati rice</li>
        <li>Onions (sliced thinly)</li>
        <li>Tomatoes (chopped)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro (chopped)</li>
        <li>Fresh mint leaves (chopped)</li>
        <li>Fried onions</li>
        <li>Saffron strands (optional)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee</li>
        <li>Water</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>        
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken with yogurt, turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, ginger, garlic, and salt. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add salt. Cook the rice until it is 70% cooked (it should still have a bite to it). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until it is no longer pink and starts to brown, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they are soft and blend into the chicken mixture.</li>
        <li>Add a bit of water if needed, and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked and the flavors are well combined.</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture. Sprinkle fresh cilantro, mint leaves, and fried onions on top. Optionally, drizzle a few tablespoons of saffron milk over the rice.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together and the rice to finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes before gently fluffing the rice and serving.</li>
        <li>Garnish with additional fresh herbs, fried onions, and serve with raita or a side salad.</li>
      </ol>
